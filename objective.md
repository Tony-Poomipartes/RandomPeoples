# Objective

Create a functioning project that accesses and displays API data from the Random User Generator.
Description
This project will test your ability to craft a small app, to communicate with an API and to show us your programmatic skills. Your goal is to build a page that displays multiple user cards at the same time – using vanilla html/css/js or  a framework if you are more comfortable, or . These cards should be similar to
what you find here (<https://randomuser.me/>). Your app should integrate with the API presented on the Random User site (see previous link, under “How to use” section), and use that data to populate your User cards.

Example of one card, as seen on the site (reminder: we want you to display multiple of these on the same page):

Some things to note:
• Use any framework you want to build the project. As long as we can run it, it’s good! You might want to include a README file with instructions to run the project.
• Take this opportunity to show us your design skills, and have fun with the design! But keep in mind the algorithmic part is the main focus. If all goes well, you should complete this task in a couple of hours. We do not expect it to be perfect and polished, the idea is for us to understand your thinking – we will discuss about it later during the interview.
Go further
We would like you to add at least two functionnalities.
You could implement
• a button that adds 10 persons
• delete a specific user card
• a gender filter
• order by date of birth
• … anything that you think could be interesting to show us what you are able to do
Turning in the project
As previously stated, if all goes well you should complete this task within a couple of hours. We ask that you turn this project in four/five days after you receive the test. We will then discuss your choices and what you would have done if you have more time with you during the interview.
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us so we can explain further.
Good luck!
